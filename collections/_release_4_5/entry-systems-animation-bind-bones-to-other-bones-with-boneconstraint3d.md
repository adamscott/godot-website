title: Bind bones to other bones with `BoneConstraint3D`
blockquote: Yo dawg, I heard you like constraints, so I put constraints in your bones so you can move bones when bones move.
text: |
  With `BoneConstraint3D` and the new `AimModifier3D`, `CopyTransformModifier3D`, and `ConvertTransformModifier3D`, it is now possible to bind bones to other bones. This can enable more natural movements and poses.

  This feature is really helpful for handling VR and metaverse avatars.
