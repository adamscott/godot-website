title: Bind bones to other bones with `BoneConstraint3D`
blockquote: yo dawg, I heard you like bones
text: |
  With `BoneConstraint3D` and the new `AimModifier3D`, `CopyTransfromModifier3D`, and `ConvertTransfromModifier3D`, it is now possible to bind bones to other bones. It opens up the door for more natural movements and poses.

  This feature is notably really helpful for handling virtual reality and metaverse avatars.
