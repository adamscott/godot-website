title: Bind bones to other bones with ``@[BoneConstraint3D](enginetype)``
blockquote: |
  Yo dawg, I heard you like constraints, so I put constraints in your bones so you can move bones when bones move.
text: |
  With ``@[BoneConstraint3D](enginetype)`` and the new ``@[AimModifier3D](enginetype)``&#x2060;, ``@[CopyTransformModifier3D](enginetype)``&#x2060;, and ``@[ConvertTransformModifier3D](enginetype)``&#x2060;, it is now possible to bind bones to other bones. This can enable more natural movement and poses.

  This feature is really helpful for handling VR and metaverse avatars.
