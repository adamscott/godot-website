  With <code class="highlight"><span class="enginetype">BoneConstraint3D</span></code> and the new <code class="highlight"><span class="enginetype">AimModifier3D</span></code>&NoBreak;, <code class="highlight"><span class="enginetype">CopyTransformModifier3D</span></code>&NoBreak;, and <code class="highlight"><span class="enginetype">ConvertTransformModifier3D</span></code>&NoBreak;, it is now possible to bind bones to other bones. This can enable more natural movement and poses.

  This feature is really helpful for handling VR and metaverse avatars.
