  User experience upgrade. We replaced the enabled property within groups with an intuitive checkbox beside the section name. You can now easily see which sections are enabled, even collapsed ones.

  Plugin developers can implement this feature in their projectrs using the new [`PROPERTY_HINT_GROUP_ENABLE`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_@globalscope.html#class-globalscope-constant-property-hint-group-enable).
