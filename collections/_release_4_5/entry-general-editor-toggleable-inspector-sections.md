  As a user experience upgrade, we replaced the ``@[enabled](membervariable)`` property within groups with an intuitive checkbox beside the section name. You can now easily see which sections are enabled, even collapsed ones.

  Plugin developers can use this feature in their projects using the new [``@[PROPERTY_HINT_GROUP_ENABLE](membervariable)``](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_@globalscope.html#class-globalscope-constant-property-hint-group-enable).
