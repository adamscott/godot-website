title: Cascade content easily with `FoldableContainer`
text: |
  The new [`FoldableContainer`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_foldablecontainer.html) node adds an easy way to display a lot of details at the discretion of the user, in an "accordion" view.

  It even supports grouping, making sure that only one foldable container is open at a time.
