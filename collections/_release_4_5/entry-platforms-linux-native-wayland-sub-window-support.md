title: Native Wayland sub-window support
blockquote: One step closer to Wayland game embedding
text: |
  Game embedding is coming for Wayland. But the support for sub-windows was an important (and not a small) hurdle to cross in order to achieve this in the future.

  Sub-window support means that Godot can now spawn new independent windows when running on Wayland natively.
