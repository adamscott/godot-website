title: Native Wayland sub-window support
blockquote: A window is worth a thousand words
text: |
  Sub-window support means that Godot can now spawn new independent windows when running on Wayland natively.

  This was also an important (and not a small) hurdle to cross in order to achieve game embedding in the future, which is already being worked on in [this PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/107435).
