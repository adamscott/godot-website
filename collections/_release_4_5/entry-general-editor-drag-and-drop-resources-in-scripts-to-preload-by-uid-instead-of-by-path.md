title: Drag and drop `Resource`s in scripts to preload by UID instead of by path
blockquote: TODO
text: |
  With [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/releases/4.4/#universal-uid-support), we extended UID support to resources in order to prevent broken paths.

  Scripts can now take advantage of this by preloading resources via their UID.

  By using UIDs instead of paths for preloading, your scripts will be more resilient, wherever the resources youâ€™re preloading are in your project.
