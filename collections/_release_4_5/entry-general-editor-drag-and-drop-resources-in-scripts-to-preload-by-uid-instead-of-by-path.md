title: Drag and drop ``@[Resource](enginetype)``s in scripts to preload by UID 
  instead of by path
text: |
  With [Godot 4.4](/releases/4.4/#universal-uid-support), we extended UID support to more resource types in order to prevent broken paths.

  Scripts can now take advantage of this by preloading resources via their UID. You just have to drop the resource while holding `Ctrl` (`Cmd` on macOS).

  By using UIDs instead of paths for preloading, your scripts will be more resilient, wherever the resources youâ€™re preloading are in your project.
