  “NativeAOT” refers to the ability for .NET applications to compile directly to a device’s native code, bypassing the need for the .NET runtime entirely.

  It notably enables faster startup times and has smaller memory footprints.

  Thanks to the newly added linux-bionic RID export support, we’re able to bring that feature for Android devices.
