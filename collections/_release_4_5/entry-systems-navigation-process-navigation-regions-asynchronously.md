title: Process navigation regions asynchronously
text: |
  The main thread of a computer program is like a project leader. If the project leader handles too many tasks and doesnâ€™t delegate enough, it can affect the overall performance of the team.

  Enabling async iterations asks the navigation servers to delegate the navigation process to a background thread, which can improve overall navigation performance.
