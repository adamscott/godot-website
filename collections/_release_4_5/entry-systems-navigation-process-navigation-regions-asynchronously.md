title: Process navigation regions asynchronously
text: |
  The main thread of a software is like a project leader. If the project leader handles too much tasks and doesn't delegate enough, it can affect the overall performance of the team.

  Enabling async iterations asks the navigation servers to delegate the navigation process to a background thread.

  Using this new feature can overall improve navigation performance.
