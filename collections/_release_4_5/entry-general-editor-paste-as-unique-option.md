  When copying and then pasting a resource in an editor inspector slot, it usually pastes a reference to the copied resources. You had to manually click afterwards on "Make Unique" in order to do so.

  Now, the new "Paste as Unique" option available in the resource picker dropdown makes the operation way less tedious.
