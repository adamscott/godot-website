  When copying and then pasting a resource in an editor inspector slot, it usually pastes a reference to the copied resources. If you wanted a unique copy instead, you had to manually click on "Make Unique" afterwards.

  Now, the new "Paste as Unique" option, available in the resource picker dropdown, makes the operation way less tedious.
