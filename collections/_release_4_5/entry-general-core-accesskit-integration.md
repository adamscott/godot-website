text: |
  Accessibility should be every developer’s top priority, full-stop. Exclude someone from an experience for factors outside of their control is an area that video games and applications have the potential to circumvent entirely. It does, however, take a solid framework to develop such accommodations.

  That's because each platform have their own way to handle accessibility. It makes it obviously difficult to support every platform.

  Fortunately, the [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/) framework launched 2 years ago in order to offer a way to bridge most of the platforms (macOS, Windows, and Unix/Linux using [D-Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus)) over a common API. Ever since, our integration of it in Godot progressed in bursts, alongside its updates.

  After 32,000 lines of code, hundred of comments, and countless hours of feedback and testing, we are proud to introduce the integration of AccessKit in the engine.

  This will enable us, over time, to offer developers more ways to integrate accessibilty features easily in their games. Starting with [screen reader support](#screen-reader-support).
