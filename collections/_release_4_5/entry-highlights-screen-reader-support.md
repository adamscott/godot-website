blockquote: Make your game accessible to visually impaired people
text: |
  Screen readers are an essential tool for people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability.[*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Screen_reader) It enables them to understand the context that is given visually.

  Thanks to the new [AccessKit integration](#accesskit-integration), we added [`Control.accessibility_name`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_control.html#class-control-property-accessibility-name). This property contains the human-readable node name that is reported to assistive apps.
