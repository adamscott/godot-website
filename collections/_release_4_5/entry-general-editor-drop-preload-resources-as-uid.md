title: Drop preload `Resource`s as UID
blockquote: TODO
text: |
  With [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/releases/4.4/#universal-uid-support), we extended UIDs support to resources in order to prevent broken paths.

  Scripts can now take advantage of this, as it is now possible to preload resources by their UID.

  By using UIDs instead of paths for preloading, your scripts will be more resilient, wherever the resources youâ€™re preloading are in your project.
