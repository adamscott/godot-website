  The animation player has received some much needed love!
  - You can use the selection box to select and scale Bézier editor points. Now it’s a piece of cake to perform batch changes.
  - When creating Bézier points, you can auto-tangent new points in a balanced or mirrored manner.
  - You can sort the animation player’s animations alphabetically.
  - It is also possible to filter animations by their names!
