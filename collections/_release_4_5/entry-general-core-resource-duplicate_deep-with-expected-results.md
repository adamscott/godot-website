blockquote: As deep as you want it
text: |
  This feature has been requested for a long time now.

  Even if `Resource.duplicate()` has a `deep` parameter, setting it to `true` doesn't always perform in a reliable and predictable way. [Notably](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/74918), it does not duplicate subresources stored inside `Array` nor `Dictionary` properties.

  The new `Resource.duplicate_deep()` method give users full control [over what gets duplicated or not](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_resource.html#enum-resource-deepduplicatemode).
