  Sometimes, addons are so good that they get promoted and included directly in the engine. This just happened to the [Godot-SMAA](https://github.com/RGDTAB/Godot-SMAA) addon.

  Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing (SMAA) is a modern post-processing-based anti-aliasing solution, to get rid of those pesky jaggies. It provides sharper AA than FXAA at the tradeoff of being more resource intensive.

  This is one step in [our quest to improve the built in post-processing effects in Godot](https://godotengine.org/priorities/#significantly-improve-post-processing-effects)!
