title: Export variables as ``@[Variant](basetype)``
text: |
  With this new update, it is now possible to export variables as ``@[Variant](basetype)``.

  Previously, a variable could only be exported as a ``@[Variant](basetype)`` if it had an initialized value. Also, the editor would stick to the actual type of said value, making it impossible to change the value to another supported ``@[Variant](basetype)`` type, such as a ``@[String](basetype)`` or ``@[Color](basetype)``.

  Now, if the exported variable is of type ``@[Variant](basetype)``, the editor reacts accordingly, permitting the user to assign any compatible ``@[Variant](basetype)`` value. Thereâ€™s even a nifty type selector that changes the input widget accordingly.
