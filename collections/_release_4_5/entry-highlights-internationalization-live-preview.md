  This new feature is key to our ideal of making gaming accessible for everyone.

  From now on, developers will be able to preview translations directly from the editor viewport.[^internationalization-live-preview-layout-direction] This will ease the burden of testing the GUI in multiple languages.

  How does your new UI react to being in French or Dutch? Or how does it look in simplified or traditional Chinese, or even in Hindi?

  [^internationalization-live-preview-layout-direction]: The layout direction only follows the main locale currently. [Weâ€™re working on fixing this issue.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/110378)
