title: Editor UI adapted for non-desktop users
text: |
  Users using a virtual keyboard as their input method can attest that the UI of the editor is really desktop-oriented. Common actions – such as undoing and saving – are tedious to execute as they require opening up the toolbar each time to find the action.

  With the new `TouchActionsPanel`, tablet and phone users now have direct access to common actions buttons.

  We intend to port this Android-only feature to other platforms as soon as possible.
