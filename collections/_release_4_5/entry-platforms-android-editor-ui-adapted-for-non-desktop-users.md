title: Editor UI adapted for non-desktop users
text: |
  Virtual keyboard users can attest to the desktop-oriented nature of the editor UI. Common actions–such as undoing and saving–are tedious to execute, as they require opening up the menu bar each time to find the action.

  With the new <code class="highlight"><span class="enginetype">TouchActionsPanel</span></code>, tablet and phone users now have direct access to common actions buttons.

  This feature is currently Android-only, but we intend to port it to other platforms as soon as possible.
