  GDExtension plugins sometimes need to run code at engine specific cues. For example, there was a lot of issues accessing the engine singletons from GDExtension, as there was no simple way to know when the engine started up or shutted down.

  From now on, developers are able to register main loop callbacks directly from GDExtension, such as `startup` and `shutdown`.

  This new feature is the result of our ongoing efforts towards bringing C#/.NET to GDExtension, as the port needed to register a `frame` callback.
