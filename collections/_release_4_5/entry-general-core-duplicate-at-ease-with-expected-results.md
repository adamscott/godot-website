  For a long time, even though [`Resource.duplicate()`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource-method-duplicate) has a `deep` parameter, people realized that setting it to `true` doesn’t always perform in a reliable and predictable way. [Notably](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/74918), it does not duplicate subresources stored inside `Array` or `Dictionary` properties. The same thing was said for [`Array.duplicate()`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_array.html#class-array-method-duplicate) and [`Dictionary.duplicate()`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/classes/class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary-method-duplicate).

  The new `duplicate_deep()` method for these classes now give users full control over what gets duplicated or not.

  This new feature is the result of an overhaul of the duplication logic for arrays, dictionaries, and resources. For developers, we made sure to keep what was working and consistent intact. If you need more details, feel free to consult our new exhaustive documentation about the duplication specification.[^duplicate-at-ease-with-expected-results]
