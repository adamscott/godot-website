title: Loading .NET assemblies directly from Android APKs
text: |
  [Assemblies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/) are the building blocks of any C#/.NET application as they provide types and resources for different functionalities. Functionalities ranging from system <abbr title="input/output">I/O</abbr> utilites to your own game logic.

  In the past, for Android, weâ€™ve been extracting the .NET assemblies from the exported APK and stored them in cache. While this works well on other platforms, it caused issues on Android, such as outdated assemblies or permission errors.

  We now load those assemblies directly from the APK, which solves all those issues.
