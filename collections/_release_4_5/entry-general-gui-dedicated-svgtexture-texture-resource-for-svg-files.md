title: "Dedicated `SVGTexture` texture resource for SVG files"
text: |
  SVGs are different from bitmap images as they are vector-based. This means that no matter how much you zoom, the shapes will never break down into discrete pixels.

  Until this release, Godot was converting every SVG file into a bitmap-based image. It is now possible to load SVG files properly (and even dynamically) with the new `SVGTexture` resource.
