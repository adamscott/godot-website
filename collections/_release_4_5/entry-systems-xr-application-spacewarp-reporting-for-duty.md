  Mobile headset resources can be sparse, so it’s important to know how to optimize the compute budget. Because XR requires a high refresh rate, developers are left with a limited timeframe to render. But what if we could use frame synthesis to our advantage? We could render at half-rate while the GPU synthesizes the next one, keeping the targeted framerate as a whole while giving ourselves effectively much more time.

  That’s exactly what Meta’s [Application SpaceWarp](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/introducing-application-spacewarp/) does on Meta and Pico headsets. We now support this technology with the latest release of our [OpenXR vendors plugin](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-openxr-vendors-plugin-400/), thanks to the implementation of motion vectors in the Mobile renderer.

  As OpenXR just released the multi-vendor [Frame Synthesis extension](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html#XR_EXT_frame_synthesis), we expect support for more headsets in the future.
