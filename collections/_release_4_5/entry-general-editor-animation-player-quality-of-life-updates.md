  The animation player did receive some needed love.
  - You can now use the selection box to select and scale the bezier editor points. It makes it a piece of cake to perform changes in batches.
  - When creating bezier points, you can now auto tangent new points in a balanced or mirrored manner.
  - You can now sort the animation player animations alphabetically.
  - It is also now possible to filter animations by their name!
