  For about two years now, all major browsers have supported WASM (WebAssembly) SIMD. SIMD stands for “Single Instruction, Multiple Data” and is a technology that permits CPUs to do some parallel computation, often speeding up the program as a whole.

  Starting with 4.5, you can expect your Web games to run a bit more smoothly, without having to do anything – especially when things get chaotic for your CPU. It isn’t a silver bullet for poorly optimized games, but it will help nonetheless.
