  Debugging can be tedious, especially if it exposes the developer to the same music over and over. One could turn off the speakers entirely, but that’s not really practical, is it?

  To keep everyone’s sanity, we introduced the new mute game toggle, located in the Game view.

  May your ears enjoy these new opportunities of quietude.
