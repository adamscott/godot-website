  Usually, developers had two choices for displaying content on the screen: either their app leaves the top and bottom areas for the system status and navigation bars, or their app could go full-screen, claiming all the space without displaying these bars.

  From now on, there’s a new export option. Android has a feature called ["edge-to-edge"](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge) display. It offers the developers the ability to draw on the entire screen, as if it was fullscreen, but with system bar overlays.

  This gives your game a more modern look that matches Android’s design style.
