blockquote: Pace yourself
text: |
  The Android Frame Pacing library also known as Swappy helps games achieve smooth rendering and correct frame pacing on Android. The library handles multiple refresh rates if they are supported by the device, which gives a game more flexibility in presenting a frame.

  As a developer, you don't have to do anything to reap these benefits: they are automatic upon upgrading your project.
