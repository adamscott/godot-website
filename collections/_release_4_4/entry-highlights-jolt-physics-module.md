  The Jolt extension has been used as the _de facto_ physics engine by many Godot developers since its inception in lateÂ 2022, so it only made sense to integrate it into the engine directly. [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) itself is actually a standalone open source physics engine and its creator helped immensely with the Godot bindings.

  While this PR might be one of the most rigorously tested ones, we are eagerly awaiting your feedback (and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues)) to eventually be able to drop the "experimental" label on this addition. Until then, you have to enable this alternative to Godot Physics in the project settings. Before you do, make sure to check if your interests/use-cases are properly supported [in the documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/tutorials/physics/using_jolt_physics.html).
