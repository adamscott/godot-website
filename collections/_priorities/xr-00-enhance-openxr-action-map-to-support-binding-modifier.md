title: "Enhance OpenXR action map to support binding modifier"
description: |
  OpenXR's action map is similar to Godot's input map, in that it allows mapping inputs to in-game actions. We'd like to enhance Godot's support of OpenXR action maps by allowing the developer to apply modifiers to the actions, such as setting thresholds, enabling haptics, or converting analog inputs (like thumbsticks and trackpads) to D-Pad-like actions.
