description: |
  Debug symbols allow developers to obtain more information when Godot crashes or logs an error. Currently, developers will only have debug symbols if they compile the engine from scratch. By distributing debug symbols for the official builds, developers would be able to easily diagnose crashes without making a custom build of the engine.
