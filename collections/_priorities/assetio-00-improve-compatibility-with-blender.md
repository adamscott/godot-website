title: "Improve compatibility with Blender"
description: |
  As [Blender](https://blender.org/) is both a FOSS and a very popular 3D editor choice by the majority of our users, it makes sense to improve compatibility with it. You can already import .blend files, but itâ€™s limited to models, textures, lights, and cameras. We intend to add support for Blender materials, modifiers, and constraints.
