description: |
  Currently, if no specific steps are taken by the game developer, resources for a game on the Web are bundled into one single .pck file. As users need to download the entire gameâ€™s assets at front, we need to find a better way to split the loading throughout the game, only when needed. This would greatly improve the starting time of the game.

    We need to investigate ways to solve the issue. We think a custom asynchronous filesystem could fix the issue, downloading files individually when needed.
