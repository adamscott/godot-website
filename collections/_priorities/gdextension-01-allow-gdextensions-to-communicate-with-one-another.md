description: |
  GDExtension was created to allow developers to create extensions as if they were coding a module directly in Godotâ€™s source code. Currently, modules can depend on one another, but this is not yet possible for extensions. We aim to expose the necessary API to be able to. So, for example, an extension built with [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/) would be able to extend an extension built with [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp).
