description: |
  As the community grows and uses more and more add-ons, we found out that the current add-on startup logic is reaching its limits, as sometimes, you need to reload the editor for new add-ons to work. Thatâ€™s why we intend to overhaul it to make the experience seamless.
details: |
  - Some research and optimization is needed for the editor file system access.
  - We need to optimize all file access extensions.
  - Ultimately, we need to rethink the current system in order to overhaul it.
