description: |
  [Before 4.3â€™s introduction of single-threaded builds](https://godotengine.org/article/progress-report-web-export-in-4-3/), we had some compatibility issues, especially on macOS and iOS devices. The problem is maybe less important than it once was, but we continue to be alert about compatibility issues that can exist now or at any point in the future.
