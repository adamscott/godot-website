  Static type hints are a well loved feature in GDScript, as not only does it improve performance, but it lowers the amount of possible typing issues.

  We intend to implement static typing for areas that currently lack them. We are thinking about typed dictionaries (already merged for 4.4) and enforcing the typing of signals.
