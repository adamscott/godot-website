title: "Make it possible to override the entire renderer using a GDExtension"
description: |
  For the ultimate control over how a game is rendered, we want to allow users to override the renderer using a GDExtension. This both benefits users with experienced teams as they can achieve any visual effect they want, but it also reduces the burden on core engine developers to support every possible feature, allowing us to keep Godot lightweight and flexible.
