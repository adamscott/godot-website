description: |
  Godot doesnâ€™t know how to handle project file changes that happen on non-imported files, such as scripts, when it happens outside of the editor. This can be a common occurrence for users that use an external code editor. This can lead to numerous errors and inconveniences, such as scenes refusing to load. We intend to make this a relic of the past.

  <div class="detail-block note" markdown=1>
    The idea would be to introduce UIDs to non-imported files, such as scripts.
  </div>
