  [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) is an open-source (MIT licensed) modern, multi core friendly rigid body physics and collision detection library, tailor-made for video games. We want to make it available to users by default, the current GodotPhysics 3D engine would still be available as an option.
