				This page can be understood as a <strong>wishlist</strong>:
				it details the software improvements that we deem necessary to make the Godot Engine a better tool for its users.
				The bullet points were created by talking to the volunteer maintainers for each area about the current state of things,
				their personal goals, and what kind of contributions they are looking for.
			</p>
			<p class="wishlist-par">
				Please understand that as with any wishlist, these points are an idealized version of what is to come in the project’s future.
				To realize them, we will need the support from you, whether you are a representative for a company looking to invest into Godot
				or a game developer eager to contribute to the codebase directly. The Godot Engine has always been a <strong>community effort</strong> -
				there is only so much ground we can cover with Godot Foundation contractors at the moment.
			</p>
			<p class="wishlist-par">
				We hope that by publishing this list, we can align our communal efforts more easily: by showcasing which areas need to see
				improvements the most and what the concrete next steps would be for anyone taking action. Let this list be an indicator of…

				<li>what areas are ripe with good first issues for new contributors, and</li>
				<li>where corporate partners could lend a helping hand</li>
